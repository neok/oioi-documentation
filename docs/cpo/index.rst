In order for a CPO to connect to an EMP and make their charging stations
available in the EMP's network, the following steps need to be taken:

* :ref:`cpo-poi-docs`
* :ref:`cpo-cdr-docs`
* :ref:`cpo-remote-start-docs`
* :ref:`cpo-rfid-start-docs`

.. warning:: If sessions in your network are stoppable, please inform the EMP.
             The EMP needs to make sure that their services allow for stopping accordingly.
